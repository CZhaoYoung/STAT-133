## Data dictionary

| Name           | Data Type  | Description                   |
|----------------|------------|-------------------------------|
| Serial_Num		 | character  | Serial Number Format          |
| Season		     | continuous | The year when storm happened  |
| Num	           | continuous | Number of the certain strom   |
| Basin		       | continuous | Basin Boundaries              |
| Sub_basin	     | continuous | Subbasin Boundaries           |

More detailed description  
Serial_Num: YYYYJJJHTTNNN
```
YYYY is the corresponding year of the first recorded observation of the storm  
JJJ is the day of year of the first recorded observation of the storm  
H is the hemisphere of the storm: N=Northern, S=Southern  
TT is the absolute value of the rounded latitude of the first recorded observation of the storm (range 0-90, if basin=SA or SH, then TT in reality is negative)  
NNN is the rounded longitude of the first recorded observation of the storm (range 0-359)
```

Basin:
```
Basin boundaries are generally on longitude boundaries.
Southern Hemisphere basins (latitude < 0°)

SI = 	South Indian 		  10° < Longitude < 135°
SP = 	South Pacific		135° < Longitude < 290°
SA =	South Atlantic		 -70° < Longitude <   10°

Northern Hemisphere basins (latitude > 0)
Two basins are defined solely by longitude:

NI = 	North Indian		  30° < Longitude < 100°
WP =	Western Pacific 	100° < Longitude < 180°
```

Sub_basin	:
```
